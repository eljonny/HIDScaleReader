HIDScaleReader
==============

A GUI with a backend that reads values from a standard HID weight scale,
based off the Stamps.com Model 510 USB scale.
I'll eventually be adding an option to choose a
/dev device or implement a USB solution that can
read the currently connected devices and give you
an option of which scale to choose.
